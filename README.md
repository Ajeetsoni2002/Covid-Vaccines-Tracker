  <p align="center">
This site
      was created to keep people informed about the administered doses of the covid vaccine <br> around the world. There are no ads, and there never will be. We          have no intention of taking advantage<br> of a global pandemic that has killed millions of people.<br><br>
      ANYONE is welcome here, I will accept any kind of contribution, whether you are a novice developer or with experience.    <br />
